# Eco-Kit
A Enviornmental Monitoring Kit

This is an Enviromental Monitoring Kit which M.A.C. has created in order to access live weather data easily.

To install the Eco Kit app you will want to download the github repository.

Windows: navigate to weather ui windows on an Anaconda Prompt. Type "pip install -r requirments.txt" . 
It should install the required librarys to the anaconda program and if all is successful its ready to run the windows application.

Mac: navigate to anaconda prompt and follow the directions in the "install text.txt" file. 

To run the application we use the spyder program included in the anaconda package.
You will want to go up to the top of spyder and open the file of the windows or macintosh version of the ECO Kit program.
It should be ready to run after that.
